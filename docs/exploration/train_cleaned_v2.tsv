The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development is in charge of helping families struggling with homelessness with housing assistance, but it does not count kids staying with friends or in motels in its definition of “homeless.” The undercount means the families of 4 out of 5 homeless children receive no federal assistance to secure a permanent or temporary home. The number of homeless students in a district does not necessarily change the size of the grant the district receives, as the money is distributed in a lump sum, not based on a per-student formula."	0

What Happens When Airbnb Swallows Your Neighborhood	https://slate.com/business/2021/10/airbnb-housing-shortage-luxury-vacation-rental-galveston-texas.html?via=rss_flipboard	Flipboard	"As Holley told me, “We had a handful of neighborhoods with largely Hispanic and Black communities that have quickly transitioned into hot spots for Airbnbs and vacation rentals, turning these close-knit areas into playgrounds for wealthy people and for partiers.” On Tuesday’s episode of What Next, I spoke with Holley about how Galveston shows the pitfalls of the short-term rental boom, and what happens when the people who make up an entire neighborhood are really just visiting, not living there. If you think about it from the perspective of an investor, if you know that you can make $250 a day by just buying a house that you can flip … it’s a great investment for a lot of people, and there’s a real incentive to invest and then not live on the island. It destroyed 60 percent of the island’s public housing, and that was one of the first changes that ushered in this new era on the island: You lost public housing and it was replaced by upscale housing and housing that has since become short-term rentals, so there’s a connection between hurricanes and affordability that continues to this day."	0

But the surge in demand for second homes started to slow as cities lifted stay-at-home restrictions, the initial shock of the pandemic faded, spring homebuying season ended and the overall housing market began to cool. The government sponsored mortgage enterprise announced plans in March to limit the number of second-home and investment-property loans it would buy, effectively making it more challenging and expensive for some buyers to take out mortgages on vacation homes."	0

Freemark: To be very honest, it depends on the community, whether the political and bureaucratic and private sector leadership and people themselves want to change the way they move around and to do so in a way that is not so reliant on automobiles to get around. They do not have to spend that money on expanding highways, but it frankly has not risen to the height of the public discourse in a way that it has in Washington, to be talking about is this the future of transportation we want."	0

At each of those steps, which will be possible beginning in January, they will earn up to $25. “The big idea is that every kid graduating is going to have a real resource for their higher education for college or career training,” said Debra-Ellen Glickstein, executive director of NYC Kids RISE, the nonprofit organization that manages the program in partnership with the city and its Department of Education."	0
Peter Politis: How the Pandemic Affected Real Estate	https://www.canadianbusiness.com/leadership-circle/peter-politis-interview-greybrook-realty-partners/	Canadian Business	"We’re also seeing a renewed interest in “sprawling living’ “with more people that are willing to consider suburban living than ever before, which has created a surge in demand for ground-related homes in the GTA and outer parts of the Greater Golden Horseshoe, in places like Shelburne, Ont., and Colgan, Ont., where we are developing. We’ll continue to see the average prices across the GTA maintain and go up, as demand for housing within the urban core continues to rise, purchasers that can afford to buy a $1-million condo in the core are now willing to buy a home with more space in other parts of the GTA, creating demand and driving up prices even into parts of the Golden Horseshoe region. There are so many moving parts and push-pulls in real estate development that if you’re not truly attuned to how they all work, it can create considerable risk."	0

Toronto ranked one of the most sexually liberal cities in the world	https://dailyhive.com/toronto/toronto-rone-of-the-most-sexually-liberal-cities-world	Flipboard	"Not surprisingly, New York City ranked top of the list with numerous gay bars, LGBTQ2S+ events and the city has been at the forefront of many major events in queer history, like Stonewall that helped spark the gay rights movement worldwide. As for why sexual freedom is so important, the authors said: “As the feminist movements of the 20th century have shown, the emancipation of genders or minority orientations is always connected with the acceptance of sexual permissiveness.” “We hope that our ranking can be a decision-making aid for all those who are looking for a place to live, where they can find their happiness and live as free from discrimination as possible,” they wrote."	0
"Dan Fumano: Tiny building, huge headache for Vancouver builder"	https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/dan-fumano-tiny-lot-big-headache-for-local-builder	Vancouver Sun	"But, Davidson said, the city took the position that the William Street office pod must go, because even though it’s less than 100-square-feet and falls under the height limit and otherwise complies with rules for “accessory buildings,” it cannot be considered an “accessory building,” because there is no “primary building” on the same lot. But there seems to be a disconnect, Turner said, “between the vision the city has and how that vision is interpreted by the planning department.” For years, Vancouver’s housing department has said the city needs more medium-density options, like townhouses and four-plexes, and several rounds of public consultation show Vancouverites want these housing types, which can be much more affordable than big detached single-family houses. Last year, after council didn’t support Stewart’s pilot project to densify single-family lots, his re-election campaign issued a press release blasting the rival Non-Partisan Association for voting to “crush the dreams of hard-working families desperate to get into the housing market.” So it seems the mayor, at least, might want one key issue of next year’s election to hinge on a big question: should the city get serious about changing the neighbourhoods dominated by single-family, detached houses?"	0

Real estate investors brace for new Liberal laws	https://biv.com/article/2021/09/real-estate-investors-brace-new-liberal-laws	Flipboard	"Many took to social media to express outrage that the Liberal Party of Canada candidate would do that when the party was promising to implement an “anti-flipping tax” that would be over and above the capital gains tax that real estate investors already have to pay on those sales.

The NDP promised in the campaign to extend the maximum amortization period for mortgages to 30 years, and this could be a part of horse-trading that the party engages in with the Liberals to support policies that the Liberals want to put in place, she said."	0

10 Common Mortgage Mistakes That Hurt Your Finances	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-common-mortgage-mistakes-hurt-210016760.html	Yahoo Finance	"If you refinance it for a 30-year mortgage with a 3.5% interest rate, you will lower your monthly payments by about $370. Perhaps this means higher than average closing costs, or by the time the buyers are ready to ‘lock’ their interest rate with the lender, the rate is considerably higher.” Not only does pre-underwriting give you certainty about how much you can offer on a home, it makes you a more competitive buyer and it might even get you the home you want for a lower price.”"	1

The analysis found that while rent burdens, which is the share of income people spend on rent, appear to be low in light of the recent growth in rent prices, this is because many renters are living with roommates or a partner.

But there seems to be a disconnect, Turner said, “between the vision the city has and how that vision is interpreted by the planning department.” For years, Vancouver’s housing department has said the city needs more medium-density options, like townhouses and four-plexes, and several rounds of public consultation show Vancouverites want these housing types, which can be much more affordable than big detached single-family houses. “But I don’t know, I should just probably stick to building mansions for rich people, because it seems to be a lot easier.” Municipal leaders say they like the idea of this so-called “missing middle” housing, but Davidson has been frustrated by a lack of tangible action."	0

Here's where you can find the lowest rent prices in Ontario right now	https://www.blogto.com/real-estate-toronto/2021/10/lowest-rent-prices-in-ontario/	blogTO	"Rents are still down on a year-over-year basis thanks to an unprecedented decline in prices amid the pandemic, but Toronto remains the second-most expensive city for renters in Canada (following Vancouver), and buying a place is straight out of the question for most people under 40. Enabled by the freedom of working remotely, people have been fleeing the 6ix in droves over the past year to buy homes in markets where it doesn't take a household income of nearly $200,000 just to qualify for a mortgage. Some realtors report that they're already seeing a new mass exodus of urbanite renters (as opposed to prospective home buyers), so there's no guarantee that prices for pads in cities like Windsor (which is hella hot right now) will stay so deliciously low... but as of right now, it's a solid option for people who can work remotely or get a new job four hours down the 401."	1

Real World Economics: When Good Intentions Go Bad	https://recentlyheard.com/2021/10/03/real-world-economics-when-good-intentions-go-bad/	RecentlyHeard	"They are key in complex information-generating and incentive-transmitting social systems that promote efficient use of resources to meet people’s needs. Economists dislike rent controls because it is impossible to find a historical case where they did suppress housing supply — either construction or the offering of more rental housing, thereby actually raising prices for those entering the market, disincentivizing home ownership, with resulting benefits flowing more to higher- rather than lower-income people. If a Venetian merchant sent five ships to Constantinople and one foundered on the way back, was it permissible in the ideas of well-meaning theologians for him to charge more for the remaining cargoes when landed on the Rialto?"	0

Toronto's 'Vital Signs' Report Highlights a Grim Reality on the Housing Front	https://storeys.com/toronto-vital-signs-report-highlights-grim-reality-housing-front/	Toronto Storeys	"One of the most resonating findings of the fresh Toronto Vital Signs Report is that the pandemic has pushed inequality to an all-time high — especially in the housing department. “According to the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), renters in the bottom 20% of the income distribution can afford only one in 500 (0.2%) of the rental units on the market in Toronto as of October 2020, which means there are essentially no units that are considered affordable for those at the bottom of the income distribution,” reads the report. They include: advancing financing and funding tools for non-profits to provide more affordable housing; increasing access to more timely data on rent arrears and evictions; putting in place stopgaps to avoid the chance of mass evictions; supporting research and advocacy for policy solutions such as revised rent controls and inclusionary zoning; embracing housing as a human right by putting the needs of the homeless and the precariously housed first; recognizing that accessing and keeping housing is predicated on a range of factors and funding the wraparound supports; and prioritizing mixed income in new housing developments."	0

As has been said so often, St Paul is a DFL town, and once someone is placed on or voted into one of the aforementioned groups, it’s basically a race to get around existing law, or changing the law, to fit progressive DFL politics. After reading “At least 4 of 7 St Paul City Council members to vote ‘no’ on rent control; mayor tight-lipped” on TwinCities.com, I’m incredibly disappointed that four council members support the deceptive disinformation of corporate landlord lobby groups who seek to maintain their unchecked power over renters in St. Paul while gouging these same tenants with unaffordable spikes in rent."	0

There’s a whole section of the menu dedicated to vegetables, including real, hand-parched wild rice, which is a treat all on its own; sweet potatoes drizzled in a delicious chili crisp; and cornbread that is kissed with a campfire flavor because it’s cooked in a corn husk. Starting with a rich, sweet borscht, the Georgian cheese bread that is like American garlic bread but better, and moving to Vareniki, dumplings stuffed with mashed potatoes and caramelized onions and some of the best potato pancakes (called Deruny) I’ve ever tasted, you can make a meal before ever getting to the single vegetarian entree, which is a stir-fryish dish called Givtech that is loaded with summer squash, cauliflower, sweet peppers and mushrooms, all cooked perfectly, kissed with dill and served over rice pilaf, or my preference, a hearty buckwheat."	0

Instead, they’re pushing for the biggest expansion of the welfare state since the 1960s, to be financed with the biggest tax increase in decades and to be passed with a three-vote edge in the House and a tiebreaker vote in the Senate on a 100% partisan basis.

Why It Doesn’t Always Pay To Pay Off Your Mortgage Early	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-doesn-t-always-pay-130054661.html	Yahoo Finance	"“A con of paying off your mortgage early is that the payments are higher and may crowd out other investments — for instance, contributing to a retirement plan or funding a child’s college fund,” said Robert R. Johnson, Ph.D., CFA, professor of finance at Heider College of Business, Creighton University. If mortgage payments are so large as a percentage of monthly income that people can’t adequately fund their retirement account or a child’s college education account, then it may be wise to simply pay your mortgage over the normal term of the loan.” “You would have to look at what the penalty is and the interest rate on the penalty, and weigh the interest rate you’d be paying with the penalty versus anything else you have debt-wise.”"	0

For instance, if your homeowner’s insurance covers $300,000 in personal liability insurance but your umbrella policy does not kick in until $500,000, you will be responsible for the $200,000 in between. The reality is that civil suits can, and often do, result in judgments or settlements that run into the millions of dollars, and judges and juries have no obligation to limit awarded damages to an amount the party being sued can comfortably afford."	0

He concludes, “Used more carefully and in conjunction with other strategies, such as directly building more affordable units, rent stabilization may serve as a partial tool to addressing the problem that a free market delivery of housing produces.” Besides establishing the 3% limit on rent increases, the ordinance also contains a provision for landlords to request exceptions based on the concept of a “reasonable return” on investment (ROI)."	0

Since the jury in California has established that Durst murdered Susan Berman, a close friend he didn’t trust to keep quiet about the events of 1982, investigators in New York City may now want to re-examine the activities of Durst and his associates in the weeks running up to Berman’s death – a time when, in his own words, he was “setting myself up to be a fugitive” – and decide if anyone else was complicit in the crime."	0

To the amazement of everyone involved in English and Welsh soccer, the purchase went through and McElhenney and Reynolds immediately made some big promises: improvements to the stadium, playing squad and leadership structure; a major investment in the women’s team; and to “introduce the club to the world.” They’ve stayed true to their word, making Wrexham stand out at a time when many clubs below the lucrative English Premier League have plunged into financial turmoil because of the effects of the coronavirus pandemic.

The value of your investment in the Fund will go up and down with the prices of the securities in which the Fund invests. The primary risks associated with the use of futures contracts are (a) the imperfect correlation between the change in market value of the instruments held by the Fund and the price of the forward or futures contract; (b) possible lack of a liquid secondary market for a forward or futures contract and the resulting inability to close a forward or futures contract when desired; (c) losses caused by unanticipated market movements, which are potentially unlimited; (d) the Advisers inability to predict correctly the direction of securities prices, interest rates, currency exchange rates and other economic factors; (e) the possibility that the counterparty will default in the performance of its obligations; and (f) if the Fund has insufficient cash, it may have to sell securities from its portfolio to meet daily variation margin requirements, and the Fund may have to sell securities at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so."	0

The practice is clustered in some of the country’s biggest markets, like Phoenix; Charlotte, North Carolina; and Atlanta, said Mike DelPrete, a scholar-in-residence at the Leeds School of Business at the University of Colorado Boulder. People are willing to pay more because “there’s a hot scramble” to buy in certain markets, DelPrete noted, saying that’s why Zestimates, Zillow’s term for its property-value gauge, are not “the be-all, end-all value of a home.”"	1

The analysis cites another study that found that over half of the properties in Vancouver, Toronto, and Halifax in the lowest income quintile were owned by individuals receiving pension income, compared to about a quarter of those in the highest income quintile. “This suggests that since buyers in the lowest income quintile are older, they may have had additional time to accumulate wealth, which could result in more capital saved for the purchase of their property,” states the analysis, including the possibility that they may have accumulated wealth through the sale of a previous home."	0

[One piece of evidence - since home prices represent a bet on the future value of properties - is that prices in the outer suburbs in the 12 largest cities are up about 12 percent from pre-pandemic values, while prices in the central business districts are down about 3%.] It makes much more sense for them to be in the city centers and for investment bankers and techies that can work from home to be out in the suburbs."	0

Johan Wiklund, professor of entrepreneurship at Syracuse University’s Martin J. Whitman School of Management, studies the link between ADHD and entrepreneurship: “We can see that people with ADHD are more likely to actually go into entrepreneurship, and then they can use some of their characteristics to their advantage in that profession,” he told Yahoo Finance. “I think it's really critical that people with ADHD choose a career that works for them, that works for their brain,” said McCabe."	0

Housing starts were down notably from August — and early numbers from August themselves revised downwards — as builders balanced elevated demand from consumers with a broken supply chain that has hobbled everyone from do-it-yourself remodelers to large-scale builders. Both scenarios are likely to continue pushing up finished home prices and pushing down home affordability, testing and possibly diminishing what has been relentless consumer demand for housing to this point."	1

There’s a whole section of the menu dedicated to vegetables, including real, hand-parched wild rice, which is a treat all on its own; sweet potatoes drizzled in a delicious chili crisp; and cornbread that is kissed with a campfire flavor because it’s cooked in a corn husk. Starting with a rich, sweet borscht, the Georgian cheese bread that is like American garlic bread but better, and moving to Vareniki, dumplings stuffed with mashed potatoes and caramelized onions and some of the best potato pancakes (called Deruny) I’ve ever tasted, you can make a meal before ever getting to the single vegetarian entree, which is a stir-fryish dish called Givtech that is loaded with summer squash, cauliflower, sweet peppers and mushrooms, all cooked perfectly, kissed with dill and served over rice pilaf, or my preference, a hearty buckwheat."	0

Domiciliary Insurance Global Market Report 2021: COVID-19 Impact And Recovery To 2030	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/domiciliary-insurance-global-market-report-141100085.html	Yahoo Finance	"For instance, according to World Population Prospects 2019 data released by the Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, by 2050, one out of six people in the world will be over 65 (16%), a rise from the one in 11 in 2019 (9 %) and the number of people aged 80 or over is estimated to triple, from 143 million in 2019 to 426 million in 2050.The rise in the geriatric population means a population with more health problems that require constant care and have limited ability to move which makes them depend on health services at the comfort of their homes. However, as all cases do not require hospitalization, hospitals are requesting the affected people to take treatment at their homes.Even people are opting for home treatment to ensure safe and effective treatment due to the fear of contracting a secondary infection from other patients in public hospitals, and the high price charges of private hospitals. This has allowed the companies in the domiciliary insurance market to cater the domiciliary insurance services along with the normal health insurance policy specific to COVID.For instance, in March 2020, Edelweiss General Insurance’s health policy has planned to cover treatment for COVID-19 which includes support to the patient during domiciliary hospitalization."	0

White House decisions on Fed leadership complicated by trading furor	https://www.foxbusiness.com/money/white-house-decisions-fed-leadership-trading	Fox Business	"While neither leader is necessarily to blame for the trading decisions of other officials, ""at the very least, if this implicates Powell, it also implicates Brainard, too,"" said Roberto Perli, a former Fed economist who is now an analyst at research firm Cornerstone Macro.

In at least one of the meetings, Mr. Powell didn’t wait for the subject of the trading controversy to come up and instead explained what had happened and what the central bank was doing to address it, according to a person familiar with the meeting."	0

There are still some things that we’re trying to do from a government lobbying perspective within certain categories like beverages, where you’re only allowed to have five individual beverages, which makes no sense if you think about it from the perspective of THC milligrams compared to say a one-ounce bag of high-potency THC strained flower,” MacDonald said.

Move Smartly Toronto Area Real Estate Market Report: October 2021	https://www.movesmartly.com/monthly-report-october-2021	Move Smartly	"It has long been argued by many housing analysts and economists that the current price acceleration trends we are seeing in the housing market in the Toronto area are entirely due to a “lack of supply” and that the cause of this lack of supply is municipal and provincial constraints on zoning (see my discussion on this earlier in this report) and “red tape” which slows down the construction of new housing. Out of all the regions in the Greater Toronto Area, the City of Toronto saw the most dramatic increase in rental listings between the pre-COVID year of 2019 and the current year, an increase of 46%. One policy solution would be to see our government put regular home buyers ahead of wealthy investors by tightening mortgage lending criteria for investors who are buying multiple properties, presumably both increasing supply as fewer homeowners would be able to keep their existing homes after they buy another and reducing demand, which is not a bad thing in a market like Toronto where nearly 1 in 4 homes are bought by investors (according to research from the Bank of Canada)."	1

This brings us to one of the biggest issues with El Salvador's Bitcoin adventure. If the country can improve the Chivo network and make it a cryptocurrency app that people trust, the potential to save on remittance fees may eventually help win over a populace that's at best unimpressed by the rollout so far."	0

If we leave it going on, and we allow for the virus to go on spreading like wildfire in the global south, there is a risk that when they, and that they can be very soon, there will be not Delta — it will be another variant that will be able to resist vaccines, and all the vaccination efforts made in developed countries, who vaccinated the whole of their population one, two or three times, all that effort will fall apart.

"Dan Fumano: Tiny building, huge headache for Vancouver builder"	https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/dan-fumano-tiny-lot-big-headache-for-local-builder	Flipboard	"But, Davidson said, the city took the position that the William Street office pod must go, because even though it’s less than 100-square-feet and falls under the height limit and otherwise complies with rules for “accessory buildings,” it cannot be considered an “accessory building,” because there is no “primary building” on the same lot. But there seems to be a disconnect, Turner said, “between the vision the city has and how that vision is interpreted by the planning department.” For years, Vancouver’s housing department has said the city needs more medium-density options, like townhouses and four-plexes, and several rounds of public consultation show Vancouverites want these housing types, which can be much more affordable than big detached single-family houses. Last year, after council didn’t support Stewart’s pilot project to densify single-family lots, his re-election campaign issued a press release blasting the rival Non-Partisan Association for voting to “crush the dreams of hard-working families desperate to get into the housing market.” So it seems the mayor, at least, might want one key issue of next year’s election to hinge on a big question: should the city get serious about changing the neighbourhoods dominated by single-family, detached houses?"	0

Banerjee says the report might not take into account the negative emotional aspects of the analysis with its claim that that even if the assumed appreciation was -10% for real estate cumulatively for the next 10 years, then assuming a moderately favourable mortgage renewal rate, the homeowner would break even."	0

For first-time homebuyers saving for their down payments, Van Leeuwen said it’s just like “creating any type of financial strategy.” Prospective buyers should analyze their budgets then meet with a mortgage broker who can suggest how much of a home they can afford based on current income, assets, debt, and credit. Despite the tempting tax code provision that allows investors to withdraw $10,000 from an IRA for a down payment without penalty, there’s still the income tax to be paid on it."	0

It has been playing up the uncertainty over how the proposed new department would work, since the amendment leaves it up to the City Council and the mayor to figure out the details within a short timeframe after the election.

Owning a home in Canada costs way less per month than renting	https://www.blogto.com/real-estate-toronto/2021/09/owning-home-canada-costs-way-less-renting/	blogTO	"A new study from Royal LePage examined hundreds of different scenarios of homeownership vs. non and found that 91 per cent of the time, people who are lucky enough to be able to scrounge a down payment of at least 20 per cent have way lower home-related monthly expenditures than tenants do — that is if a mortgage payment is looked at as saving, rather than money that is spent. Money spent on a mortgage, meanwhile, is what the realty giant calls ""forced saving,"" with the principal (the actual mortgage payment, to which interest — another expenditure that can be considered thrown into the abyss as far as the owner's future is concerned — is added) considered ""not a true cost."" In this sense, the company assures residents (in their own best interest, of course) that even if the cost of your home doesn't appreciate over time, the purchase can still be considered worthwhile, and you are still far better off financially than a renter (which someone who has the capital to purchase a home usually already is)."	1

Harris County evictions trending up as federal moratorium ends	https://communityimpact.com/houston/cy-fair/housing-real-estate/2021/10/14/harris-county-evictions-trending-up-as-federal-moratorium-ends/	Community Impact	"“The challenge with the eviction moratorium all along has been that people had to meet certain criteria and fill out a moratorium declaration and take that with them to court, and quite a lot of folks didn't know how to do that, didn't have the support they needed to do that or were scared to use it,” said Leah Barton, director of strategic initiatives with the Office of County Administration. Those most likely to face evictions are those with young children—due to the high cost of child care and the fact that it is more difficult for parents of young children to work—and those living on a fixed income, such as seniors, Barton said. The program can cover up to 18 months of rent as far back as April 2020, and up to two months can be allocated to current or future rent to allow tenants time to get back on their feet."	0

Colorado has its share of famous graves and memorials — gunfighter Doc Holliday (buried at a trailhead in Glenwood Springs), Buffalo Bill Cody (buried on Lookout Mountain), Ute Nation Chief Ouray (buried at Ouray Memorial Park in Montrose), Philip K.

Average home prices have soared more than 2,000% since the privatisation of the housing market since the 1990s in a fast-urbanising China, and in recent years, creating an affordability crisis especially among millennials.

Nurses and Teachers Settling for Less to Keep Costs Down	https://rismedia.com/2021/10/01/nurses-teachers-settling-less-keep-costs-down/	RISMedia	"While the median rent burden in most large metros for teachers and nurses falls below that 30% level, people in these professions are only able to access a fraction of the market if they want to maintain that level. As vital professions are either being priced out or having to settle for smaller living spaces with longer commutes, Bachaud said cities can start taking steps to address these issues, which have made it difficult or nearly impossible for many communities to support nurses and teachers. Relaxing zoning restrictions—specifically allowing single-family lots to build housing for two or four families—could quickly create vast swaths of new living spaces, with another Zillow study from 2019 estimating that this change in even 10% of lots could create 775,000 new homes in the Los Angeles metro, which amounts to more than a 50% increase over current stock."	0

The advantages of blockchain technology for the real estate sector in this context are almost gigantic; in particular, the divisibility of real estate into small, tradable units now offers real estate a larger investor group - which is why a revolution could currently be in the offing that will open up completely different and, above all, new opportunities for the entire real estate market worldwide!"	0

Toronto housing market at 'critical juncture' as plunging listings push high prices higher	https://financialpost.com/real-estate/toronto-housing-market-at-critical-juncture-as-plunging-listings-push-high-prices-higher	Financial Post	"Try refreshing your browser, or Toronto housing market at 'critical juncture' as plunging listings push high prices higher Back to video The board and other real estate organizations are calling on government to take stronger measures to address supply shortages to help take the wind out of red-hot prices that are keeping many out of the market and could hurt the economy in the longer term. “With new listings in September down by one third compared to last year, purchasing a home for many is easier said than done.” TRREB said the lack of housing supply has reached a critical juncture, adding that “bandaid policies to artificially suppress demand have not been effective.” The real estate board called on all three levels of government to create stronger policies to address a shortage of new housing supply. “This is particularly relevant given housing markets in Canada are often a good indicator of economic activity in the country.” While it may be good for the economy in the short term, Alexander said there is “no doubt that the rapid price growth we’ve experienced recently is cause for concern.” While there are indications single-detached-home price acceleration may be starting to level off in some urban centres, prices are continuing to rise in many smaller cities and communities that were once “havens for affordability.”"	0

Is another housing bubble on the horizon?	https://finance.yahoo.com/video/another-housing-bubble-horizon-205114452.html	Yahoo Finance	"The question is, are we in a kind of housing bubble that you should be worried about? Sometimes, I think those 5 million jobs down from the best of best times late in 2019 before the pandemic, sometimes I think we're closer to full employment simply because we've lost 5 million jobs because people have dropped out of the labor force. The other thing about the dropouts, you know, a lot of times, politicians will say we've got to bring those people back into the labor force."	1

The total homeless population in Plano is down this year, but the number of homeless people not staying at a temporary shelter is up, according to the latest point-in-time census report from the Plano Neighborhood Services Department.Officials from the department presented the report at the Sept. 27 City Council meeting.The report classifies individuals as being either sheltered, meaning they are living in temporary housing, or unsheltered, meaning they are sleeping in a vehicle, abandoned building or camp site.During a single day in 2020, there were 161 sheltered and 92 unsheltered individuals in Plano, for a total of 253 homeless people, the report showed. An estimated 100 families were in shelters, while 100 students resided in hotels or motels as their permanent home.Shanette Eaden, the city’s housing and community services manager, said the COVID-19 pandemic was a factor in the changing homeless population.“COVID happened, ... and it affected all of our residents—homeless and those that are not homeless,” she said.In partnership with county and federal funds, the city spent over $2 million in the past fiscal year on various homelessness prevention and housing assistance programs.Eaden said staff is working to create a homelessness dashboard that allows city officials and residents to stay up to date on monthly statistics in the city.Council Member Rick Grady became emotional while speaking about the importance of educating community members on factors that can lead to homelessness.“When people look at homelessness, they think that's the problem and the cure is to either move them out or put them in a box, and that does not solve the issue,” he said during the Sept. 27 meeting."	0

For example, during California’s budget emergency following the 2008 financial meltdown, the Obama administration and the Democratic Congress sent the state a lifeline in the form of large federal transfer payments funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, also known as the “stimulus package.” But there was no guarantee that other congresses and administrations would be willing to bail out the state every time its spending commitments exceeded its capacity to pay."	0

Amid higher consumer demand for goods that have been in short supply, freight rates for goods coming from China to the U.S. and Europe have soared, while a shortage of truck drivers across both the latter regions has exacerbated the problem of getting goods to their final destinations, and has led to high prices once those products hit store shelves.

Toronto's 'Vital Signs' Report Highlights a Grim Reality on the Housing Front	https://storeys.com/toronto-vital-signs-report-highlights-grim-reality-housing-front/	Toronto Storeys	"One of the most resonating findings of the fresh Toronto Vital Signs Report is that the pandemic has pushed inequality to an all-time high — especially in the housing department. “According to the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), renters in the bottom 20% of the income distribution can afford only one in 500 (0.2%) of the rental units on the market in Toronto as of October 2020, which means there are essentially no units that are considered affordable for those at the bottom of the income distribution,” reads the report. They include: advancing financing and funding tools for non-profits to provide more affordable housing; increasing access to more timely data on rent arrears and evictions; putting in place stopgaps to avoid the chance of mass evictions; supporting research and advocacy for policy solutions such as revised rent controls and inclusionary zoning; embracing housing as a human right by putting the needs of the homeless and the precariously housed first; recognizing that accessing and keeping housing is predicated on a range of factors and funding the wraparound supports; and prioritizing mixed income in new housing developments."	0

However, time on market in Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, and Baltimore was still lower than more typical rates in 2019, and time on market in San Diego and Buffalo was similar, meaning that while the housing market this fall isn’t quite as hot as last year, homes are still selling faster than in 2019 in all except two of the largest 50 metros."	0
‘Overheated’: Demand continues to outpace supply in Hamilton housing market	https://www.thespec.com/business/real-estate/2021/09/30/hamilton-housing-market.html	Flipboard	"A senior analyst for the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) says Hamilton’s housing market remains “overheated” as supply continues to play catch-up with demand. The latest report from the corporation, released Tuesday, rated the city’s real estate market as having a high degree of vulnerability — mirroring trends of price acceleration and overvaluation across the country. That “intensifying competition” has played a part in the acceleration of home prices in Hamilton, according to the report, which could result in overvaluation of homes in the city."	1

Budget 2022 failed to provide what was required to deliver Housing For All	https://www.irishexaminer.com/opinion/commentanalysis/arid-40719657.html	Flipboard	"In Budget 2022, Government failed to commit to a target of 20% of all housing stock to be social housing, with an annual capital envelope of €3.3bn for social housing. The specific commitments made in the Housing for All Strategy to increase protections for tenants, increase inspections, investigate deposit protection schemes, and introduce long-term leases did not receive any mention in Budget 2022, meaning development of a functioning private rented sector is still a long way off. The zoned land tax introduced in Budget 2022 in order to increase the supply of land for building homes allows for the owner of land that falls eligible for the tax to get the zoning status amended, as well as having a two year lead-in time for land zoned pre January 2022, and three years for land zoned after this date and, as a result, is unlikely to generate the volume of sites really needed to address the ever more serious lack of housing across the country."	0

Based on 2021 second-quarter data, Dunning found that a home renting for $2,795 a month, including $280 for utilities, would cost $3,499 a month to own with a 25-year mortgage amortization — about $705 more than renting the same house or apartment."	0

Lofty prices for liquefied natural gas, coal and oil were a positive for the Aussie as Australia is a major energy exporter and is now routinely boasting record trade surpluses month to month, bringing a natural flow of cash into the currency. One drag on the Aussie has been the very dovish stance of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) which held rates at 0.1% at its policy meeting this week and reiterated that no hike was likely until 2024."	0

Try looking at a plot of the U.S. stock market or the U.S. housing market since the Covid-19 recession and see if you are intuitively tempted to assume that you have discovered a powerful upward trend that will continue for years to come."	0

There’s a whole section of the menu dedicated to vegetables, including real, hand-parched wild rice, which is a treat all on its own; sweet potatoes drizzled in a delicious chili crisp; and cornbread that is kissed with a campfire flavor because it’s cooked in a corn husk. Starting with a rich, sweet borscht, the Georgian cheese bread that is like American garlic bread but better, and moving to Vareniki, dumplings stuffed with mashed potatoes and caramelized onions and some of the best potato pancakes (called Deruny) I’ve ever tasted, you can make a meal before ever getting to the single vegetarian entree, which is a stir-fryish dish called Givtech that is loaded with summer squash, cauliflower, sweet peppers and mushrooms, all cooked perfectly, kissed with dill and served over rice pilaf, or my preference, a hearty buckwheat."	0

Some HELOC rates start at around 2% right now. What credit score do you need to get the lowest rates?	https://www.marketwatch.com/story/some-heloc-rates-start-at-around-2-right-now-what-credit-score-do-you-need-to-get-the-lowest-rates-01632755829?link=MW_latest_news	MarketWatch	"“A borrower does not need to know the final cost of remodeling at the time that they get the line of credit established, can pay contractors as work gets completed, and jump on any opportunities or change their mind during the project.” Indeed, experts say that many lenders require a credit score of at least 620 – 660 to grant you a HELOC at all, and a score of 720 to 740 and above to give you the most favorable rates and terms. The more equity you have in your home (the appraised value of your home minus the remaining balance on your mortgage), the more flexibility you may have if your credit score needs some improvement."	0

First, Banerjee points to the fact that the press release clearly states it is a conditional analysis — the condition being the aforementioned assumption that everyone has the ability to bring a 20% down payment to the table. Banerjee says the report might not take into account the negative emotional aspects of the analysis with its claim that that even if the assumed appreciation was -10% for real estate cumulatively for the next 10 years, then assuming a moderately favourable mortgage renewal rate, the homeowner would break even."	1

While Canada’s appeal to students from around the world is undoubtedly something to celebrate — and these individuals will without question enrich the cultural fabric of our cities — the return of international students on real estate markets is difficult to ignore.
